The packaging is predominantly white with green accents and features illustrations of cows and a green leaf, indicating it is a dairy product.\n\nIn Image-2, the object is a carton of Ekosk Gärdar 1.5%, which is a skimmed milk product. The packaging is predominantly white with green accents and features illustrations of cows and a green leaf, indicating it is a dairy product. However, the product name and the percentage of fat content are different, indicating it is a skimmed milk product.\n\nTherefore, the two images show different dairy products.",
