The surrounding area is relatively clean, with only a few scattered items.\n\nIn Figure 2, the fire pit is more robust and the fire is visibly larger and more intense. The surrounding area is more cluttered with additional items, indicating that the fire has been burning for a longer period.\n\nTherefore, the primary difference between Figure 1 and Figure 2 is the region marked in 🟨 (green), which shows the progression of the fire and the changes in the surrounding area over time.",
