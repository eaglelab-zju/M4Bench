Let's analyze the options:\n\n* **(A) [861, 7, 972, 204]** This region appears to be part of the street sign \"Laver 300\". This region is virtually identical in both images.\n\n* **(B) [182, 376, 922, 1024]** This region covers a large portion of the stop sign itself.  This is where the major difference lies, as the second image has the dog silhouette within this area.\n\n* **(C) [49, 479, 181, 680]** This region corresponds to some of the trees on the left.  The trees are basically the same in both pictures.\n\n* **(D) No difference.**  Clearly incorrect, as the dog silhouette is a significant difference.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B).  The region [182, 376, 922, 1024] in figure 1 contains just the stop sign's surface, while the same region in figure 2 contains the stop sign and the added dog silhouette.
