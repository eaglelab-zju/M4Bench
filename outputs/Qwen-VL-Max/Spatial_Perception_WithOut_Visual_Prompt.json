      "model_full_prediction": "To determine the semantic corresponding parts, we need to identify features in both images that are similar or serve a similar purpose.\n\n1. In image-1, the bounding box [232, 276, 298, 328] appears to be around the label on the toilet tank.\n2. In image-2, the bounding box [458, 216, 511, 256] is around the top part of the pizza delivery box.\n\nGiven these observations, the most reasonable correspondence would be:\n\nB. [232, 276, 298, 328] in image-1 and [458, 216, 511, 256] in image-2\n\nThis choice aligns the label on the toilet tank with the top part of the pizza delivery box, which are both labels or markings on objects.",
