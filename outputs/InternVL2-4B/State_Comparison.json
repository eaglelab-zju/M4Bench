In the first image, the cream is being whipped into a fluffy, airy texture, as evidenced by the peaks and the overall volume increase. This process is known as whipping cream, which involves beating the cream until it becomes light and voluminous.\n\nIn contrast, the cream in the second image is in its liquid state, as indicated by the smooth, untextured surface and the measurement markings on the pitcher. This liquid cream is likely to be used for cooking or baking purposes, where it will be incorporated into recipes as a liquid ingredient.\n\nTo summarize:\n- The cream in the first image is whipped and fluffy.\n- The cream in the second image is liquid and unwhipped.\n\nThus, they are in different states.",
